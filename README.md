# Lung Cancer
Lung cancer is a lethal lung disease that causes more than one million of deaths yearly. It is one of the most common medical conditions in the world. By definition, lung cancer is a malignant lung tumor that is characterized by uncontrollable growth in the lung tissue. Early detection of lung cancer could reduce the mortality rate and increase the patientâ€™s survival rate when the treatment is more likely curative. Computed tomography (CT) imaging is an efficient medical screening test used for lung cancer diagnosis and detection. The physician uses the obtained CT images to analyze and diagnose the lung tissues. However, in many frequent cases, it is difficult for the physician to obtain an accurate diagnosis without the help of additional tool known as Computed Aided Diagnosis (CAD) System. 
# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
A convolutional neural network, or CNN, is a deep learning neural network sketched forprocessing structured arrays of data such as portrayals.
CNN are very satisfactory at picking up on design in the input image, such as lines, gradients,circles, or even eyes and faces.
This characteristic that makes convolutional neural network so robust for computer vision.
CNN can run directly on a underdone image and do not need any pre- processing.
A convolutional neural network is a feed forward neural network, seldom with up to 20.
The strength of a convolutional neural network comes from a particular kind of layer called theconvolutional layer.
CNN contains many convolutional layers assembled on top of each other, each one competentof recognizing more sophisticated shapes.
With three or four convolutional layers it is viable to recognize handwritten digits andwith 25 layers it is possible to differentiate human faces.
The agenda for this sphere is to activate machines to view the world as humans do, perceiveit in a alike fashion and even use the knowledge for a multitude of duty such as image andvideo recognition, image inspection and classification, media recreation, recommendationsystems, natural language processing, etc.
